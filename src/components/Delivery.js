                    <p>Research employing physical and computational injury simulation has shown that brain stress and strain are both useful variables to describe injury risk, including concussion (Zhang et al., 2004; Doorly and Gilchrist, 2006; Kleiven, 2007; Sahoo et al., 2016). Finite element analysis has elucidated how trauma/tissue strains are associated with injury severity. Injury reconstructions have estimated a 50% risk of sustaining a concussion from maximum principal strain (MPS) values of 19â€“30% found in gray- and white-matter cerebrum (Zhang et al., 2004; Kleiven, 2007; Patton et al., 2013; Rousseau, 2014). However, many head contacts commonly occurring during contact/collision sports either do not present visible signs of neurologic dysfunction, or are not reported and therefore not clinically diagnosed.</p>
